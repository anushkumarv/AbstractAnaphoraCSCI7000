The story to this point says that the KLRC’s present strategic direction has a foundation in what Kimberley Aboriginal people want for their languages. The issue for the organisation is that we now operate with a different model of revival and maintenance to funding bodies, academic institutions and Western language teaching models.
There are opponents of what the organisation is doing. Disputing the wisdom of the KLRC’s community capacity building focus a linguist stated, ‘I believe that it is one of the roles of the KLRC is to turn scientific studies into materials for use in the community. There are many languages in the Kimberley and the KLRC needs to employ well more than a dozen linguists’ (pers. comm., 20 March 2006). Another linguist observed that Aboriginal people in the Kimberley are being let down because documentation is not being encouraged (pers. comm., 19 Marc 2007).
Such views inform government. If the board and membership have set a different agenda for preserving their languages, what evidence is there that their chosen method of language continuation will not work? There is plenty of academic research that suggests that it will work. If Aboriginal people believe it will, then that also overcomes another concern of one of the linguists quoted above about lack of interest from young Aboriginal people in Western linguistic study. Caffrey concludes that even for Aboriginal people who have undertaken linguistic studies ‘formal linguistic training has made limited contribution to the documentation and maintenance of Australia’s Indigenous languages to date’ (2008, p. 236).
The concern the KLRC Board of Directors wants addressed is the lack of recognition of the role Aboriginal people not only want to but have to play in the continuation of their own languages. This concern can be explored by asking two further questions:
