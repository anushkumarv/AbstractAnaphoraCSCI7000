Despite many successful projects facilitated by the Kimberley Language Resource Centre, this approach did not result in sustainable revival strategies for Kimberley languages and has not dramatically increased language use. We describe how the organisation has in recent years gathered Aboriginal community perspectives on language revi- val resulting in a revision of the strategic plan and management model. The organisation’s focus is now strongly directed towards community-managed revival with emphasis on promoting pre-school language acquisition. After summarising the reasons for changing direction we refer to the strategies being used to support it. We then go on to discuss how this approach struggles to receive support outside the Aboriginal communities the organisation works with. Grant bodies, particularly government ones, are reliant on Western academic perspectives on maintenance and revival when assessing funding submissions. In neither the organisation’s context nor the social context do they accept with equal validity Aboriginal people’s perspectives on how to revive their own languages. The Kimberley Language Resource Centre was established under a model of self-governance in the early spirit of self-determination. After briefly describing the operational changes and current strategies we conclude by setting out the difficultis of getting support for Aboriginal self-determined strategies. We do this by asking two questions: (a) whose responsbility is language continuation at the community level and why does the answer, the community, pose a problem for the Kimberley Language Resource Centre? and (b) why are Aboriginal revival strategies seen as less valid than the strategies of Western academia and education?"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-05-06T02:01:14.429450Z","updated_at":"2023-05-06T02:03:28.766722Z","inner_id":1,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":4,"updated_by":2,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":94,"annotations":[{"id":118,"completed_by":2,"result":[],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-05-06T02:03:42.093246Z","updated_at":"2023-05-06T02:03:42.093299Z","lead_time":1.214,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"81823228-fdda-478a-8ca7-87484ccc0c2e","last_action":null,"task":94,"project":4,"updated_by":2,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"1a4a9fe1-144_147.txt","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"corefText":"The aim of this paper is to tell a story.
