This belief leads to the intersection of ideologies about proficiency and prescriptivism or ideologies of linguistic correctness and ‘efforts to regulate the language of others’ (Straaijer 2016, cf Curzan 2014: 17), resulting in conflated discourses of proficiency, language purity, and ‘in- correctness’.

Agency is increasingly understood as relational and dynamic rather than as an ‘individual internal state or quality’ (Bucholtz et al. 2018: 4) closely associated with motivation,3 as has been traditional in applied linguistics and education. Ahearn’s (2010) influential definition understands agency as ‘the socioculturally mediated capacity to act’ (p. 28), a capacity which is simultaneously individual, relational\/interpersonal (Mercer 2012), socially contextualized, and political (Bucholtz et al. 2018). However, ideologies of the individual agency remain influential in obscuring the social conditions or ‘complex ecology of affordances and constraints’, which are embedded within social histories and which conscribe individuals capacities to act (Miller 2016: 345–55). Since meta-understandings of agency relate to ‘notions of personhood and causality’ (Ahearn 2010: 30), individualized ideologies of agency contribute to moral discourses of praise (Park 2010) and blame in language learning. hybridity stigmatized (Zentella 1997). The term ‘heritage speakers’,2 encompassing speakers’ sociocultural relationship to a language as well as the full range of bilingual competencies, arose to challenge these deficit perspectives (Valde ́s 2001; Lynch, 2003; Hornberger and Wang 2008). However, ‘com- mon-sense’ myths such as ‘bilinguals have equal and perfect knowledge of their languages ... have no accent in their different languages ...

Sample questions included ‘What is Latino life like in D.C.?’, ‘Do you think there are stereotypes about Latino people?’, ‘What does being Latino mean to you?’, ‘Is language an important part of Latino identity?’, and ‘How do you feel about your Spanish and English abilities?’ Seventeen interviews were conducted one-on- one by the researcher, a non-white non-Latino second-generation immigrant who speaks fluent Spanish and participates in local Latino social networks. The combination of peripheral community membership and word-of-mouth recommendation, coupled with the shared experience of racial minoritization, family migration, and intergenerational bilingualism, encouraged frankness and a sense of commonality. Participants were made aware that the researcher spoke Spanish (many already knew this, given word-of-mouth referral) and that interviews could be conducted in English, Spanish, or a combination as they preferred. Following participant language leads, the interviews were conducted in English with code-switching. The remaining five interviews were conducted in English by non-Latino interviewers,4 four one-on-one and one-by-two interviews. These interviews were also loosely guided by sociolinguistic questions designed to elicit casual speech following Labov (1972), such as ‘What was it like when you were growing up?’ which elicited participants’ thoughts and experiences with Latino identity, Spanish, and migration.

Rather than being validated, their actual bi-lingualism was overlooked in favor of an idealized native-speaker target, and the label of inadequate Spanish was imposed as an iconic aspect of generational identity. The second-generation speakers did not generally resist the imposed positioning of themselves as inadequate Spanish speakers, indicating the durability of ideological constellations encompassing monolingual ideology, native-speakerism, and notions of language purity and correctness. Even He ́ctor, who contested the notion that Latinos ‘must’ speak (native-like) Spanish, had internalized insecurity about his Spanish—insecurity into which he was socialized through community interactions and judgment. The second generation speakers reported that the resultant linguistic insecurity led them to avoid Spanish in settings that warranted its use. This finding resonate with the previous research showing that well-intentioned purism can discourage heritage language use (Bradley 2013: 6–7; cf Dorian 1994; also see Hill and Hill’s 1986 work on Nahuatl and Spanish bilingualism in Mexico) and expands the ideological constellation to include related ideologies of agency, ethnicity, and belonging."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-05-05T23:28:46.060637Z","updated_at":"2023-05-05T23:46:03.726429Z","inner_id":27,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":3,"updated_by":2,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":90,"annotations":[{"id":102,"completed_by":2,"result":[],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-05-05T23:46:15.891154Z","updated_at":"2023-05-05T23:46:15.891207Z","lead_time":1.273,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"10719cb1-dd60-4bd5-b112-0049215896a8","last_action":null,"task":90,"project":3,"updated_by":2,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"fa80a406-113_130.txt","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"corefText":"The first-generation immigrants force-positioned second-generation immigrants as inadequate speakers both in interviews and in reported interactions, a positioning which second-generation participants had internalized.

It thus not only undermined second-generation speakers’ identities as competent Spanish speakers but also led to questioning of later generations’ authenticity and group membership.

Similar to ideologies of proficiency and correctness, the ideology of individual agency erased and, paradoxically, curtailed later-generation speakers’ actual linguistic agency as well as causing identity tension, as in this case the perceived ‘willful rejection’ of the minority language and culture.
