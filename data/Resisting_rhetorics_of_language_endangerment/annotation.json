Fifteen years later this still remains a subject of concern. In this article I examine how three related strategies are increasingly employed in both academic and public domains: Linguistic extraction is the process of discussing languages and language reclamation movements removed from the personal lives, communicative practices, and embodied experiences in which they inherently are embedded, while the erasure of colonial agency minimises the historical and ongoing causes of language endangerment and dormancy, sometimes to the extent of misattributing agency for such realities onto Indigenous communities themselves. Lasting is a discursive process through which Indigenous populations are framed as ‘vanishing’, first by defining Indians based on a singular characteristic, and then lamenting the passing of the ‘last’ Indians assumed to have had that single defining characteristic (O’Brien 2010). I explore the implications of these rhetorics for both endangered language movements and the communities at the center of those movements, with a particular emphasis on the discursive tactics that resist these strategies which are utilised by Indigenous community members and language activists."

The rhetorical strategies deployed are intended to raise public awareness about language endangerment. These strategies are the focus of this paper, which draws on a corpus of articles and online posts from the past decade published in established, English-language newspapers, media outlets, and magazines with wide, multi-national circulation in both digital and print formats, and increased dissemination through social media platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, and Facebook. The rhetorics discussed here come from examples of media coverage of language endangerment with the highest circulation, identified by the number of reader subscriptions for print media, and the number of accesses, shares, ‘likes’, and reposts for digital formats. I focus on media discussions of language endangerment, because, as Nancy Rivenburgh (2011:704) notes in her examination of how English-language media frame the causes and implications of language endangerment: ‘For better or worse, people rely heavily on media to understand how these global phenomena touch their lives’."

Fifteen years later, we have several answers. As this article will show, the world was listening. It responded through the creation of new policies and in some cases an ideological shift away from shaming and devaluing language diversity to a valorisation of those same languages. At the same time, the rhetorics identified by Hill now extend from academic papers and grant proposals into mainstream media discourses about language endangerment and the affected communities. The three themes Hill identified are: ‘universal ownership’, ‘hyperbolic valorisation’, and ‘enumeration’. Universal ownership, as Hill defines it, is the positioning of endangered languages as belonging to everyone, especially the target audiences for language advocacy, ‘who must be convinced that they “possess” this particular form of wealth and are somehow responsible for it’ (Hill 2002:121). A related process is hyperbolic valorisation through which languages are framed as ‘resources’ that have ‘value’, utilizing economic metaphors such as languages being ‘treasures’ or ‘priceless’. Finally, enumeration involves the ‘essentialization and individualization of a language as a sort of unit’ (Hill 2002:127), and heavy reliance on statistical representations to describe endangered languages at a global scale. Critically, Hill does not argue that all uses of these themes are bad, but rather that researchers should consider their rhetorical strategies carefully, including alternative frameworks of representation such as a rhetoric of human rights."

      "corefText": "Building on Hill’s framework, I examine three additional related strategies that are increasingly deployed in both academic and public domains, and which are evidenced in the corpus of popular and scholarly texts reviewed in this paper: linguistic extraction, erasure or misattribution of colonial agency, and ‘lasting’. Linguistic extraction is the process of discussing languages and language reclamation movements extracted from the personal lives, communicative practices, and embodied experiences in which they are inherently embedded. The erasure of colonial agency minimises historical and ongoing causes of language endangerment and dormancy, sometimes to the extent of misattributing agency onto Indigenous communities themselves. Lasting draws on O’Brien’s (2010) identification of the discursive and semiotic process through which Indigenous populations are framed as ‘vanishing’, and applies it specifically to practices within the context of Indigenous and endangered languages. It is replicated in discussions about ‘last speakers’ and over-emphasis on declining speaker populations (Muehlmann 2012) rather than new speakers and positive language reclamation effects. By examining these widely circulating rhetorics, within studies of broader colonial framings of Indigenous people within Native American and Indigenous studies, I will demonstrate how such rhetorics both draw on existing trends within settler societies and continue to influence them. Then, I will ‘listen’ to a different body of rhetoric – produced by members of endangered language communities and in ethnographic accounts of language reclamation – in search of discursive strategies of linguistic survivance that resist colonial tropes and neo-colonial desires of language-as-resource extraction.

Linguistic extraction, then, renders languages into extractable objects that can be collected, preserved, utilised, and even admired. Critically, linguistic extraction is not solely the collection of endangered and Indigenous languages in ways that often render them inaccessible to their communities, but also the presentation of languages as objects, or data, without their complex and varied human contexts. In his analysis of both popular and scholarly literature about endangered languages, Moore (2006:297) asserts that it ‘summons its readers to an encounter with these languages as monuments in a sculpture garden of human cognitive achievements, objects of wonder and appreciation’. Like the natural resources and ‘treasures’ with which they have been frequently aligned, Indigenous and endangered languages – as a whole or in their component pieces – are frequently utilised in processes labeled ‘mining’ and ‘harvesting’ by researchers within this extractive framework. This literal and metaphorical extraction from context is itself a colonial enterprise and often a cornerstone of Western science – one that removes people from homelands, loots objects from graves in the name of science and education, and disassociates products from those who labour to produce them. In other words, it celebrates the empire in empirical. Extraction is the foundation of enumeration identified by Hill, where qualities of languages or people are counted and then detached from their larger dynamics."

      "corefText": "Linguistic extraction also happens in valuing linguistic data over the speakers from whom it comes, and the communities and contexts in which it is produced. Take, for example, this representative excerpt from a National Geographic article on ‘Languages racing to extinction in 5 global “hotspots”’ (Lovegren 2007:1) setting up the backdrop for the story’s focus on language endangerment: In the last 500 years, an estimated half of the world’s languages, from Etruscan to Tasmanian, have become extinct. But researchers say the languages of the world are now vanishing faster than ever in recorded history. More than 500 languages may be spoken by fewer than ten people. In this article, which had over 8,000 ‘likes’ and around 2,000 ‘shares’ on Facebook alone, decontextualised enumeration allows for the available numbers to appear randomised, as though in a world with thousands of languages, all are equally at risk of endangerment; or, in a community with 500 speakers and a population of 50,000, any individual out of 100 might be a speaker. In reality, these numbers are embedded in particular (but interrelated) geographic, socio-economic, familial, and historical contexts. Their rhetorical presupposition reveals another level of extraction frequently utilised in media discussion of language endangerment: the erasure of factors that shape language shift. In Lovegren (2007) no rationale is given for why the last 500 years might be a significantly different moment in language transmission, even though it coincides with the period of European and American colonialism and globalisation."

According to Unesco, more than 130 of these languages are currently at risk, with 74 languages considered ‘critically endangered.’ These languages preserve priceless cultural heritage, and some hold unexpected value – nuances in these languages convey unparalleled knowledge of the natural world.

In the context of seemingly transparent numbers outlining the ‘crisis’ or ‘epidemic’ of language endangerment and a sudden, if de-historicised valuing of Indigenous languages by a global public, readers are left with the looming question – why?"

Borrowing conceptually from Newton’s first law of motion, we can posit that languages tend to remain in motion – being transmitted to subsequent generations – unless an external force is applied to them. Omitting those forces from discussions of language endangerment leaves out a critical piece of the equation and contributes to the larger pattern of erasure originating in settler-colonialism – this omission is particularly problematic when such forces are still actively at work. Here, linguistic extraction is the gateway rhetorical process to the erasure of colonial agency and the misattribution of agency onto endangered language communities for their own linguistic demise, discussed in the next section."

The word also utterly fails to account for the crisis’s roots in history and law. Using the word epidemic to talk about violence in Indian country is to depoliticize rape.

In fact, the blame for the plight of Indigenous languages is often ascribed to the communities themselves, or individuals within them. This is perhaps most visible in the metaphor of ‘language suicide’, which posits that a group that loses its language may do so by choice (Denison 1977). However, as Crawford (1995:24) notes, the ‘suicide’ frame of language death ‘explains little about the social forces underlying such choices. Whether deliberate or not, the notion of language suicide fosters a victim-blaming strategy’. Media representations frequently use language denoting that full (de-historicised) agency regarding the future of languages lies with endangered language communities. The title of the previously-cited National Geographic 2007 article, ‘Languages racing to extinction’, brings to mind a competition for fun or sport toward language attrition. Linguists working on language documentation are quoted describing the context in which language shift occurs (emphasis mine):"

Language shift and language acquisition are represented as fully agentive choices linked only to ‘social prestige’ and ‘social pressures’ or some kind of unknowable impediment, and, while the inclusion of ‘social pressures’ hints at external factors, the final and repeated emphasis places agency on the community. The placement of agency on children here is particularly problematic when we consider that children are often the primary target of linguistic violence and regimes of cultural genocide (e.g., boarding schools, child welfare act, removal policies),, while simultaneously having the least power within the sociocultural language dynamics in which they are represented as ‘simply’ making such choices."

      "corefText": "Children are not the only people within endangered language communities singled out as the agents of language attrition in the media. In communities where endangered languages are spoken fluently by few people, particular individuals are often identified as the cause of the decline of language transmission. Perhaps the most widely discussed example is the (partially fictionalised) story of two speakers, Manuel Segovia and Isidro Velázquez, of the Indigenous language Ayapaneco in Mexico. A 2011 Huffington Post article about the now infamous feud between two men presents the situation as follows (emphasis mine): Though the language has been spoken in what is now Mexico for centuries, there are only two people left who can speak Ayapaneco fluently. Like so many other indigenous languages, it’s at risk of extinction – even more so because, as the Guardian reports, the last two speakers are refusing to talk to each other. This widely circulated and re-worked story was shared from the Huffington Post webpage over 3,500 times, and also became the focal point of a campaign and advertisement series by the British telecommunications company, Vodafone. The two fluent speakers of Ayapaneco are repeatedly identified as the reason Ayapaneco will not be spoken by future generations using a rhetoric that parallels the placement of all agency in language endangerment onto Indigenous communities (see Suslak 2011 for a response and thorough contextualisation of the Ayapaneco media coverage and its consequences). Phrasing like ‘it’s at risk of extinction ... because the last two speakers are refusing to talk to each other’ directly links language dormancy – here problematically called ‘extinction’ (discussed further in section 1.3, below) – to the very late-in-life actions of two individuals whose personal feelings toward each other are of no consequence to a world desperate to extract valuable knowledge hidden within the treasure chest of Indigenous languages. From this external evaluative perspective, Indigenous people owe it to the rest of the world not only to provide aspects of their culture, life, and knowledge of the world to outsiders on demand, but also to be friends with anyone else involved in accommodating those demands."

In it, she describes a small Native American community who has decided that language documentation by outsiders simply to preserve aspects of the language for scientific goals did not fit with their understanding of how languages should exist. After only three days visiting the community, which includes her relatives, the author, who is from Wales, concludes her discussion with: ‘In the age of mass information, the choice of the Maidu shows that without trust and engagement, valuable knowledge and understanding can be lost forever’ (emphasis mine). Here, the ‘choice’ of the Maidu is combined with an additional extraction in terms of language endangerment and loss disconnected from the conditions of the Maidu community. Such articles never lament the decline or demise of Indigenous sovereignty or autonomy, the loss of political, economic, or geographic stability and power, or even the strong correspondence of language attrition with the actual necropolitical dynamics in marginalised communities. In fact, as I discuss in the next section, Indigenous (language) death is only noteworthy when it is the ‘last’."

Of the rhetorical strategies in news media discussed in this paper, ‘lasting’ may be the most prevalent. Historian and Native studies scholar O’Brien (2010) coins the term lasting for the discursive process through which Indigenous populations are framed within local New England histories as ‘vanishing’ by defining Indians based on a singular characteristic – full blood quantum in the case of nineteenth century New England. Lasting, then is a process of what Irvine & Gal (2000) call iconisation (rhematisation) and erasure. First, specific individuals or characteristics are made iconically representative of larger wholes – be they groups, languages, or cultures. Erasure happens in two concomitant processes: (1) other characteristics or people that could be representative of the larger whole are erased; and (2) the larger whole is erased through the countdown, or ‘lasting’, of those iconic few. Lasting is, then, a specific configuration of hyperbolic valorisation and enumeration."

Consider the first words of Thurman’s (2015) New Yorker article, ‘A loss for words: Can a dying language be saved?’ (emphasis mine): It is a singular fate to be the last of one’s kind. That is the fate of the men and women, nearly all of them elderly, who are – like Marie Wilcox, of California; Gyani Maiya Sen, of Nepal; Verdena Parker, of Oregon; and Charlie Mungulda, of Australia – the last known speakers of a language."

      "corefText": "While each individual represents a particular type of speaker within much larger communities, they are presented as ‘the last of [their] kind’. Such rhetoric directly reflects 17th century descriptions of the ‘last of’ tribes in New England, as well as popular accounts such as The Last of the Mohicans (Cooper 1888), The Last of the Dogmen (Hershey et al. 1995), and Ishi the Last Yahi: A Documentary History (Heizer & Kroeber 1979), where specific individuals (historical or fictional) were held up as the last of their community, thereby marking the extinction of whole groups of Indians, and all Native Americans more generally. This technique is used to make spectacularly famous (and famous spectacles of) individuals, like Ishi, deemed to be the ‘last’. Thus, National Geographic hosts a webpage that invites readers to ‘See and Hear Last Speakers of Dying Languages’, Wikipedia lists 59 individuals from around the globe in a ‘List of last known speakers of languages’, and, as mentioned above, various online news outlets circulated a story throughout 2011 and subsequent years titled: ‘Last two speakers of dying language refuse to talk to each other’."

      "corefText": "There are three elements of the lasting of endangered languages that are of particular importance. Firstly, those identified as the ‘last’ speakers of languages are only very specifically understood as ‘speakers’ in a narrowly defined way: native speakers (those who learned the language from birth/childhood); monolingual (speaking only the language of interest); fully fluent (those able to participate in any and all domains of language use and communication in the language); mentally sound; and with a particular heritage (ethnic and/or cultural origins within the communities associated with the language). However, these are not the same criteria applied to the classification of ‘speakers’ of non-endangered languages, and such a narrow restriction of who gets counted as a speaker, or a holder of linguistic expertise and knowledge, erases those who fit one or more, but not all of the listed qualities. As Leonard & Haynes (2010:279) point out, researcher determinations of who is, and is not a speaker ‘without having come to understand what being a speaker means within the cultural context extends the historical colonialist practice of imposing Western ways of knowing without acknowledging that other ways of knowing exist’. Furthermore, narrow, linguistically-derived definitions of speakerhood effectively erase bilingual speakers and learners, and exclude potential members of multilingual communities (De Korne 2017)."
