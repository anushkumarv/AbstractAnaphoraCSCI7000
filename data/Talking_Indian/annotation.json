One of the most prominent aspects of this campaign was the Indian Removal Act of 1830, under which Indigenous nations east of the Mississippi River were relocated to Indian Territory in the current state of Oklahoma. Through this militarily enforced government policy, the entirety of the Chickasaw Nation—along with large portions of the Muskogee (Creek), Seminole, Choctaw, and Cherokee Nations— was relocated from 1837 to 1838 in what has been memorialized as the Trail of Tears. Each tribe was given territory within Oklahoma, although those territories were dramatically reduced as more and more tribes were relocated to the area. In total, Oklahoma became home to forty-seven federally recognized tribal governments.

This book attributes internal diffusion to a process that I am a calling “accumulation through dispersion,” or privatization, through which public assets—in this case land—are privatized and commodified. This process has contributed to a linguistic and social diaspora even within the geographic boundaries of the Chickasaw Nation’s territory in Oklahoma. For example, the Dawes Act, or General Allotment Act of 1887, divided the collectively owned lands of the Chickasaw Nation into individual parcels and then made them the private holdings of individual citizens. This meant that non-Natives—and notably U.S. and Oklahoma governmental agencies and private corporations—were able to inherit or purchase the land itself and the mineral (oil) rights. As a result, the tribe’s citizens and political power are dispersed even within the jurisdiction of the Chickasaw Nation. Primary and secondary schools, for instance, are under the purview of the state education system, and city and state police forces have jurisdiction alongside Chickasaw authorities throughout the tribe’s jurisdiction. This internal dispersal has had various impacts on language revitalization efforts within the tribe. For example, when working to create Chickasaw language classes for the high school level, the Language Department had to go through the process of gaining approval and certifi- cation from the Oklahoma State Board of Education as a foreign language curriculum. The restructured Chickasaw Nation encompasses thirteen counties in south-central Oklahoma.

One example of external diffusion was produced through the Urban Indian Relocation Act of 1956, which worked to relocate Native peoples individually or as families to urban locations throughout the United States, such as Chicago, New York City, San Francisco, and Denver. Through this policy, hundreds of Chickasaw families relocated outside of the tribal jurisdiction in Oklahoma to select metropolitan locales, becoming part of the 78 percent  of Native Americans and Alaskan Natives living outside of their tribal jurisdiction, according to 2010 U.S. Census Bureau statistics. Critically, Teresa McCarty and Richard E. Littlebear (2013) remind us that this movement of Indigenous peoples outside of their tribal jurisdictions does not represent a severing of community ties or Indigenous identity, pointing out that there “is often a great deal of transmigration of individuals and families back and forth between urban and rural\/reservation areas” (7).

While modern, global interactions between more or less anonymous individuals create a heightened need for individuals to utilize broader semiotic systems to convey specific identities (112), he is quick to point out that it would be incorrect to assume that the same need is absent within smaller, more close- knit communities. In such population dynamics, he explains, “Interaction typically occurs between people, often kin or fictive kin, who know each other in so many roles that they must interactionally establish which identity is situationally relevant” (113). Within the Chickasaw community, individuals must negotiate the most relevant of many available identities in a given interactional moment; for the most part, the remaining native Speakers of Chickasaw come from a small number of families and many are related to each other and the other participants in our language revitalization efforts. So in the context of a language committee meeting, for example, participants may index their available identities relating to familial connections, occupation, community roles, language expertise, and so on. In sum, identities are not innate, prediscursive states; rather, they are constantly shaped and reshaped through interactions with others. Furthermore, individuals do not have a single, unitary identity; any one individual has numerous available sociocultural positions that become relevant depending on the immediate context. In fact, in her work on Indigenous language and identity in thenorthwest Amazon in Brazil, Sarah Shulist (2016) has demonstrated that Indigenous people must negotiate identity dynamics across a spectrum of “graduated authenticity” in which they are not simply negotiating what it means to be Indigenous along a binary of “‘authentic’ and ‘inauthentic’ Indigenous or non- Indigenous— but rather one in which varying degrees of authenticity can be assigned based on different ideological configurations of the language-identity relationship” (113). By focusing on a context of Indigenous identity within these shifting sociopolitical dynamics, this book seeks to excavate some of the heterogeneous and complex notions of Indigenous selves that exist in Indigenous communities of the Americas. How do members of an Indigenous community situated in a rapidly changing economic and demographic landscape negotiate their national and ethnic identities? How does an orientation to learning the Chickasaw language define indigeneity? This book will contribute to discussions of the complexity of Native identity and language (and cultural) revitalization."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-05-05T23:22:51.219239Z","updated_at":"2023-05-05T23:22:58.060920Z","inner_id":23,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":2,"updated_by":2,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":60,"annotations":[{"id":73,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"start":281,"end":285,"text":"That","labels":["NonAbsAnph"]},"id":"ZiPz5B5fHL","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"from_id":"ZiPz5B5fHL","to_id":"ZiPz5B5fHL","type":"relation","direction":"right","labels":[]}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-05-05T23:23:05.793216Z","updated_at":"2023-05-05T23:26:11.748589Z","lead_time":10.138,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"f5dfe234-3a7f-44f3-85ef-cffaaa7e6ef4","last_action":null,"task":60,"project":2,"updated_by":2,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"bcb860b7-19_20.txt","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"corefText":"Identity positions are performed and negotiated through language. As such, this book draws on the “tactics of intersubjectivity” proposed by Mary Bucholtz and Kira Hall (2004), in which the individual is seen both as subject to social processes and the subject of those processes. That is, individual identity is seen as resulting from both individual agency, including both deliberate performances and habitual practices, and social structures that the individual does not directly control. In other words, individuals do not have a single, unitary identity, but locate themselves relative to a variety of available sociocultural positions. Identity positions are thus negotiated and emergent in discourse as interactants position themselves (and are themselves positioned) with regard to any number of identity characteristics and groups.

Linguistic anthropologist Gabriella Modan’s (2007) concepts of “centralized” and “marginalized” identities are useful for interrogating the intersection of place and identity in Chickasaw discourses. In her analysis of how inhabitants of the Mount Pleasant neighborhood in Washington, D.C., work to frame themselves as authentic members of the neighborhood—while framing others as inauthentic or unacceptable— Modan proposes three kinds of local identities: 1) various identities for the neighborhood itself, 2) identities that speakers create for themselves as core community members, which we can call centralized identities, and 3) identities that speakers create for others as lesser community members, which we can refer to as marginalized identities. (7) Similarly, negotiations over which identities count as authentically Chickasaw (and over the type of place the Chickasaw Nation used to be, is, or should be) are articulated through a wide variety of social contexts and linguistic genres. Residents draw on these semiotic resources—and reinforce or contest them—in their interactions with each other and with broader institutions."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-05-05T23:22:51.219478Z","updated_at":"2023-05-05T23:23:13.593737Z","inner_id":25,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":2,"updated_by":2,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":62,"annotations":[{"id":75,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"start":476,"end":480,"text":"that","labels":["EvAnph"]},"id":"oOdAyYU6FQ","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":242,"end":410,"text":"This discourse positions those who have always (since relocation) lived within the tribal jurisdiction in south-central Oklahoma as centralized members of the community","labels":["EvAntd"]},"id":"pxbEjZnIVf","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"from_id":"oOdAyYU6FQ","to_id":"pxbEjZnIVf","type":"relation","direction":"right","labels":[]}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-05-05T23:24:10.578379Z","updated_at":"2023-05-05T23:24:10.578428Z","lead_time":55.861,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"515e1c2e-cffd-45bb-898d-118111038108","last_action":null,"task":62,"project":2,"updated_by":2,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"bcb860b7-19_20.txt","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"corefText":"Four discourses are commonly employed to discuss belonging in the Chickasaw Nation.
